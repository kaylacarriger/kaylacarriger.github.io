Stress-Correlations
Stress and Lifestyle Factors Analysis This project analyzes the correlations between stress levels and various lifestyle factors using a dataset titled "Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv." The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, where data inspection, cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis are performed.

Project Overview The primary goal of this project is to explore how different lifestyle factors, such as sleep duration, quality of sleep, exercise levels, heart rate, and daily steps correlate with stress levels. The analysis includes:

Data Inspection and Cleaning:

Reading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Inspecting the data for any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers.
Cleaning the data to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
Data Visualization:

Creating various charts and graphs to visualize the distribution of factors like sleep duration, quality of sleep, exercise levels, heart rate, and daily steps
Highlighting the relationship between these factors and stress levels.
Correlation Analysis:

Running a correlation matrix to quantify the relationships between stress levels and other lifestyle factors.
Plotting the correlation matrix to easily visualize which factors are strongly correlated with stress levels.
Conclusion:

Summarizing the results of the correlation matrix.
Discussing which lifestyle factors appear to have a significant correlation with stress levels and which do not.
Installation To run this project locally, you’ll need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
You can install the required libraries using pip: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Dataset The dataset used in this analysis, Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv, contains data on individuals’ sleep patterns, exercise habits, heart rates, daily steps, and stress levels.

Results The final output of the analysis includes:

Visualizations that illustrate the distribution and relationships between different lifestyle factors and stress levels.
A correlation matrix that quantifies how strongly each factor is correlated with stress levels.
A summary that highlights which lifestyle factors are most strongly associated with stress levels, offering insights into how lifestyle choices might impact stress.
Acknowledgments The dataset used in this project was sourced from kaggle.com. Inspiration for this project came from the intersection of data analysis and mental health.
